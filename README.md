# Sublime VSCode Theme

[![Marketplace](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version-short/yurihs.sublime-vscode-theme.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/yurihs.sublime-vscode-theme)

This theme aims to make your VSCode look just like Sublime Text,
including the light sidebar.

Based on [Maximetinu/Sublime-Text-Monokai-theme-for-Visual-Studio-Code](https://github.com/Maximetinu/Sublime-Text-Monokai-theme-for-Visual-Studio-Code/tree/master).

## Installing

This extension can be installed from the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/yurihs.sublime-vscode-theme).


## Text contrast issues

Due to the lack of color customization options offered by VSCode, the light sidebar causes a few other things UI elements to be unreadable. I'm working on resolving this problem. See [issue #1](https://github.com/yurihs/sublime-vscode-theme/issues/1) for more details.
